# RushHourSolver
In this project you will write a solver for the Rush Hour game . Your input will be a file containing rush hour puzzles. You will need to solve the puzzles by getting the XX car to the exit on the right, and write the solutions in the output file.

To solve the puzzles we used graph exploration algorithms we discussed in class:
BFS/DFS/A*.
